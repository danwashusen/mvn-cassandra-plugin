A Maven plugin that can be used to start a test Cassandra instace within a Maven project.

NOTE: This plugin uses non public Cassandra APIs.  I imagine it could stop working if 
only minor changes are made to the internals of Cassandra.  Use at your own risk!

!!!!!!!!! WARNING !!!!!!!!!
The latest dev release of 0.7.0 (2010-07-31) breaks this plugin because of the following call in FBUtilities:
ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader().getResourceAsStream("org/apache/cassandra/config/version.properties");

Maven separates the classloaders so the system classloader is unaware of the plugins classpath changes (and as a result
 the version.properties file can't be found).
!!!!!!!!! WARNING !!!!!!!!!

See http://github.com/danwashusen/pelops/blob/master/pom.xml for a usage example.
